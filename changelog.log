Added:
+ Added sale calculator, just click on "Edit" link on your premium resources, go to the section that you set the price/exchange and paypal account, and you will see a new "Sale: " label, just set the sale percent you wanna do, and press Apply Sale! it will update your "Cost: " label to the correct price =D I think that this is a very usefull feature

Minor:
+ Updated exchanges, we have to remove the realtime API in old updates, and now for some reason there is some errors that get fixed when updating exchanges
+ Removed ajax
+ Readded fixer.io, this will send a request, and if fails then will we use old data
